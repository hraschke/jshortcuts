NAME
     ala -- Quickly manage aliases for specific network interface.

SYNOPSIS
     ala [ip address] [interface] [-hr] [-i interface] [-a ip address] [-n netmask]

DESCRIPTION
     Use ala to quickly add remove an IPv4 alias for a specific network interface.
     This can be helpful to communicate with devices that use static IP addresses
     and are configured with an address that does not appear on your current LAN.

     Often, this is the case for IoT devices (relays, meters, sensors, BACnet &
     ModBus bridges, etc.) that come out-of-the box with a specific IP, but can
     be reached with an alias, or with hardware that is staged for shipment to
     the field.

     The options are as follows:

     -i interface
             Sets the interface on which to create an alias, e.g., "en0". The
             default for this can be set in the .jshor_config file.

     -a ip address
             Sets the IPv4 address of the alias to create. The default
             for this can be set in the .jshor_config file.

     -n netmask
             Sets the IPv4 netmask of the alias to create. The default
             for this can be set in the .jshor_config file.

     -r      Sets the remove flag. If this option is passed, an alias will
             be removed if it matches the ip addresss and interface specified.
             If the ip address and interface do no match, no alias will be added.

     -h      Shows the help page. Seems you've already figured that one out.
