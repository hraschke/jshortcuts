NAME
     conf -- Quickly open a confluence page in your browser.

SYNOPSIS
     conf  [query] [-hcfN] [-b browser] [-s confluence cloud server address]

DESCRIPTION
     Use conf to quickly open up the Atlassian Confluence Cloud application with
     a browser. Either pass a query to search for a page, or omit a query to go
     to the Confluence home page for you organization.

     The options are as follows:

     query
             A query to search for articles in Confluence.

     -b browser
             A string that indicates the name your computer uses for a browser,
             e.g., "Google Chrome" (quotes required for two-word strings),
             "Safari", or "Firefox".

     -s confluence cloud server address
             Indicates the first portion of the URL to go to, which differentiates
             Atlassian cloud instances, for example, the "server-address" of
             "https://server-address.atlassian.net/wiki".

     -c      Sets the browser option to "Google Chrome".

     -f      Sets the browser option to "Firefox".

     -N      Specifies that the browser should open the page in a new window, rather
             than a new tab.

     -h      Shows the help page. Seems you've already figured that one out.
